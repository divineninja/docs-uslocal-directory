## Introduction

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the USLOCAL walkthrough project. The project demonstrates a complete workflow for registering listing information with two flexible payment processing options:

1. **Agent-Registered Payment**: The agent directly registers the customer's credit card information
2. **Customer-Self Payment**: The agent sends a secure payment link allowing customers to register their own card details

The documentation includes detailed step-by-step walkthroughs for both agent and customer workflows, complete with screenshots and instructions.
